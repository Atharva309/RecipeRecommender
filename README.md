# Using Ingredients to Recommend Dishes

This project uses machine learning to recommend dishes based on a list of ingredients provided by the user. The project utilizes a dataset of over 200,000 recipes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions), which includes information on each recipe's name, ingredients, and other attributes.
